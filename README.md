# ITRW316-Exam_Project_1

Write a web system (.NET, PHP, Node, etc) that ask the user for two words (the original word and a new word), a specific text file is opened and the original word is replaced with the new word.  This can cause a problem if more than 1 person tries to make changes at the same time (as only one text file is used for everyone).  Compensate for "simultaneous" use of the file.  Deploy the solution on :

    Windows VM with IIS (.NET system)
    OR
    Linux VM with AMP/MEAN (PHP/Node system)

Write a report on the project, what the issues/goals where, the possible solutions that might be used, as well as the development you did on the system.  (2 to 4 pages).  Don't submit anything here.  All exam reports will be submitted as one report on eFundi under "Eksamen verslag / Exam report".  Work in groups of 2 or 3.  Code MUST be on git!  (Private repository)
